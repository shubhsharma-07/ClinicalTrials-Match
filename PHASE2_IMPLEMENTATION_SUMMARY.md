  - Phase ordering (1, 2, 3, 4)
  - Recency by trial ID

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "trials": [...],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 5,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "hasNextPage": false,

  "assessmentId": "ASSESS_1754762352402_l06i24m8f",
  "matches": [...],
  "summary": {
    "title": "2 Trials Found",
    "description": "We found 2 clinical trials that match your profile...",
    "recommendations": [...]
  },

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Route Ordering
- Fixed route conflicts by placing `/api/trials/search` before `/api/trials/:id`
- Prevents Express.js from treating "search" as an ID parameter

### Data Enhancement
- Eligibility strings parsed into arrays for frontend consumption
- Related trials automatically calculated
- Contact information added for better user experience

### Scoring Algorithm
- Weighted scoring system (40% cancer type, 20% age, 20% treatment, 20% location)
- Detailed match explanations for transparency
- Configurable scoring weights

### Assessment Management
- In-memory storage with unique ID generation
- Session-based assessment tracking
- Ready for database migration
